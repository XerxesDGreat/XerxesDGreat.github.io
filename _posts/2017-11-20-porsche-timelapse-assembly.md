First off, I'm no film maker. I like to be creative, and I feel I have a sense of artistry, but I'm
totally at a loss when it comes to how to make film (or video as I guess it _should_ be called now).
Therefore, I fake it with gimmicks. You know, things like building a time lapse of me assembling a
large LEGO project; you've seen the evidence of this before, I'm sure!

My most recent project was the massive Porsche 911 GT3 RS model that LEGO released in 2016,
[set number 42056](lego-store-link). This thing is 1:8 scale which is just HUGE. Basically everything
 works more or less as it would in a production car, from easy things like suspension to more difficult
 things like transmission Drive and Reverse and the flappy paddle gear box which _actually changes gears_!
This thing is truly incredible.

I'm considering putting a lighting system in it, but I don't really feel like spending the money at the
moment. I _did_ set up a special place for it on my shelves, and it's lit from the top by a strip of
RGB LED lights. I have to do something with the strip since the adhesive it comes with sucks and didn't 
hold the strip, but it's fun to cycle through the colors; I know Cora loves it!

Any rate, about the time lapse; I wanted to go more artsy with it, so I thought of how I could make it
more epic. This led to the music, then to the various inserted cuts. I find that just watching a time
lapse start to finish is a little boring since there's nothing new about it; I wanted to change that and
inject some points of interest. Therefore, after each box (there are 4), I took some progress pics and
to kinda give a sense of scale of the epicness of this build. I borrowed a 40mm prime lens from a friend
in order to do this; I wanna buy it, but see above about not wanting to spend the money.

Any rate, enough words; here's the time lapse!
