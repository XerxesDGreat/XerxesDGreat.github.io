<p>Okay, I admit it. I ran out of dedication. I have in the past 2 weeks, I've missed&nbsp; half of my days. I think that part of the reason there is feedback; I am too nervous/shy/whatever to say "hey, you wanna see a card trick" to adults, but don't feel like Cora gives me a proper audience since she's 6. Without feedback, showing the tricks is hard to get right.</p>
<p>Any rate, I'm actually pretty pleased overall though; I started with more than a week left in August, so I did more than 30 days total, and I think that the outcome has been pretty stark. I'm a lot better at card magic than I was before!</p>
<p>Of course, I need more practice to become better. I think this is going to continue to be a hobby of mine, playing around with cards. I would like to work card manipulation, shuffles, etc. into other boring stuff so I can just get the mechanical practice, but that's a matter of having time free where my hands are doing nothing. I guess I can bring them to meetings :-p</p>
<p>Any rate, right now, I'm in deep with two projects: an assembly time laps for my LEGO Porsche 911 and a cutting board for Christmas; they'll be taking my time for the next couple of weeks. Thus, I think I should do a 30 days which fits in with this (more or less). So, I'm going to choose "off screens by 11pm". This includes phone screens (no more Cracked while brushing teeth), computer screens, TV, etc. I&nbsp;<em>can</em>&nbsp;use a non-backlit screen like Shanin's Kindle Paperwhite; the goal here is to cut out the blue light associated with electronic devices an hour before I go to bed in the hopes that I'll fall asleep better. Of course, I might be bored enough without to just go to bed sooner... and that's fine.</p>
<p>Also, I should mention that this does&nbsp;<em>not</em> include emergencies, whether of the work, phone-call-in-the-middle-of-the-night, or emergency room variety. Common sense will dictate, and I'm going for spirit of the law, not letter.</p>
