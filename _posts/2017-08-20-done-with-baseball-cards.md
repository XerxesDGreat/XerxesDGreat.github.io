<p>It seems that I get to cross another thing off my list. I've decided to give the baseball cards away. Mayhap I'll regret it at some point, but it's easier for me to just give them away instead of going through all of them or selling them. Someone else will be able to enjoy them more than I will... maybe. Who knows. It's possible they'll get disappointment too. But, if they do, at least I'll have the room back :-)</p>
<p>So, starting tomorrow, I will do one of the REAL ones, one of the tasks which is straight for improvement. I'm not sure which I'll do, but it needs to be something that's fun. Or, at least, something which improves me in some way. I'll choose tomorrow.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
