Timelapse time again! This time, it's the massive [Crawler Crane (#42042)](https://shop.lego.com/en-US/Crawler-Crane-42042), complete with various actions!

This moves forward, pivots, and the crane... picker upper thingy goes up and down, and the scaffolding for the crane
also raises and lowers. It's pretty great!

I tested its lifting capabilities using a glob of 4 packs of Bucky Balls which weigh close to 1 kg and, while it bogged
down, it actually lifted them and was able to turn! The second half of the video below is sped up by 2x, so it took a
while, but it's understandable considering <!-- more --> I'm using rechargeable batteries which just don't pack as much oomph as
alkaline ones. Also, LEGO crane. Probably not winning any lifting contests...

Enjoy!

Oh, and since I keep on forgetting to post it, I assemble all the images into a single video using ffmpeg:

```
ffmpeg -r 30 -pattern_type glob -i '*.jpg' -c:v copy output.avi # 30 fps in this case
```
