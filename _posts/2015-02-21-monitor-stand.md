This isn't news or anything, but apparently [sitting](https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/21/health/sitting-will-kill-you/) in a [chair all day](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-15004/sitting-all-day-is-really-really-bad-for-you-infographic.html) is [pretty bad](https://qz.com/223160/why-not-even-exercise-will-undo-the-harm-of-sitting-all-day-and-what-you-can-do-about-it/) for you,
[even if you exercise](https://time.com/2977994/sitting-all-day-isnt-as-bad-if-you-do-this/). By contrast, using a desk which allows you to [alternate between standing and sitting](https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2014/08/the-health-benefits-of-standing-versus-sitting/)
can alleviate [much of the the problem](https://www.baua.de/cae/servlet/contentblob/717578/publicationFile/48508/A65.pdf). So, when my work asked me if I wanted a standing desk, I said sure, but I
told them I didn't have a doctor's note or anything; the official policy was that I'd need a doctor's note to get one.

Flash forward a few weeks and I was asked if I still wanted one, and I responded in the same way. They said "well, we
 have one, so get your stuff off your desk, and it'll be set up for you by Monday". Cool! I then joined the cool kids
 who stood up while they worked and looked ACTIVE!
 
Last week, we did a team reorganization, moving people's seats around. When I came back in, I found that they'd given me
a much shorter standing desk; so small that I'd be looking down at my monitors, which is bad for my neck. I decided that
I needed a monitor stand and, since I had wood hanging around at home (and since I don't like to be a PITA for HR), I
 decided to make one

And here it is! I pulled all the pieces from another project I abandoned, so I was not out any money. The top I'd made
to practice planing, joining slats of wood together, and making and installing butterflies to deal with cracks. I made
it from birch (I think) or maybe spruce and it was about 33% wider than this; I didn't need anything quite that wide, so
I just cut off the worse-looking side of the slab. The legs are just pieces of 2x4 resawn in half and then glued together.
The finish is two steps: first step, I did the vinegar and steel wool trick to give it an aged/weathered look, and the
second step is Danish oil.

Overall, I think it turned out pretty well. It looks old and kinda beat up, which is the look I was going for. Mostly, I
just wanted to a) get some practice in making some simple furniture, b) not spend a bunch of money, and c) have something
which won't look horrible, but still looks different from everyone else's monitor stands. And I think that I made my
goal!
