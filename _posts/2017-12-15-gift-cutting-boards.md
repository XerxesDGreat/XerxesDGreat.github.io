For Christmas (and just because) I decided I wanted to make some cutting boards for my family. I've been watching
videos by MTMWood on YouTube for some time and wanted to try out the process, see if I could make something good.
So I got a few designs together and got started.

The process for each of these is pretty easy; make long pieces, the cross-section of which will show on the face
of the board, then glue these long boards up in various ways until you get a row/column, slice to thickness of the
board, then do the final glueup. It's not _super_ intuitive or easy to describe, so here's an example from MTMWood:

{% include embed/youtube.html id='zqgbbziBkvo' %}

And, as a matter of fact, I did that exact board! Here's before gluing and finishing:

And then oiling it up with cutting board oil

_The best part of the project_

I made a couple more. I like this one because it reminds me of Q-Bert

_See? The pyramid of blocks?_

And then for _some unimaginable reason_ I didn't get a picture of the last one I made; it looks a lot like this
only more rectangular in the horizontal direction

_Can't believe I didn't get a picture of this one_

I had a really good time, though it was a _lot_ of fine, precise work to get everything to line up. I'd happily
make another one (or several) as long as I had someone to give/sell them to.

Cheers!
