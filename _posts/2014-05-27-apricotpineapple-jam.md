I found this recipe at the [Keeping Up With Mrs. Smith blog](https://keepingupwithmrssmith.com/jams-jellies/old-fashioned-apricot-pineapple-jam/), a site with a bunch of really good looking and
exciting recipes. One thing which wasn't mentioned and that I discovered is that this makes about five pints (or, in my
case, 10 8-oz jars) of jam, so prepare for that! Tried some of the leftover I had to put in my fridge and it is quite
tasty!
