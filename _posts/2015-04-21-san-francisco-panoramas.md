Shanin and I went to San Francisco for a delayed anniversary and to get away for a while. We had a great time, though we
*did* walk a long way! On Thursday, we did two round trips from our hotel behind City Hall ([Inn at the Opera](https://www.extraholidays.com/san-francisco-california/inn-at-the-opera.aspx),
quite a nice place) to the Tenderloin for dinner and because I forgot my card there (oops!): about 3 miles. On Friday,
we did a long hike from our hotel down to Market St., up to the Castro Theater, from there on an urban hike to Twin Peaks
and back, to the hotel, back a ways down Valencia for dinner, then back to the hotel: 15 miles. On Saturday, we took a
ferry out to Alcatraz for the [Ai Weiwei @Large exhibit](https://www.for-site.org/project/ai-weiwei-alcatraz/) and walked around there a bit, then decided to walk back to the hotel: 12 miles. By Sunday, we were
beat, so the non-walking [Duck Tour](https://sanfrancisco.ridetheducks.com/) around the city and into McCovey bay was welcome!

It was a gorgeous weekend; a little overcast on Sunday, but it cleared up. So I took this opportunity to get some panos
of a very picturesque city with great weather. Enjoy!
