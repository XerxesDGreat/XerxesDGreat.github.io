So, one of the hobbies or crafts or whatever I've gotten into from time to time is knitting. I made a pretty nice scarf
for Shanin, a matching hat (kinda had trouble joining it up on top), and a scarf and a hat for my brother Lucas (neither
of which were very good). Recently, I've gotten back into it a little. I made a scarf for Cora and one for myself (will
have other post(s) for those later) and was happy with the way Cora's turned out.

Because I like hats, I decided to knit a hat for myself. I browsed through various (easy!) patterns and found one I
liked [on this blog](http://knitbot.com/blog/2010/11/22/daisy-chain-hat-pattern). It had the right mix of not-completely-boring and easy-to-make, so I thought I'd give it
a shot.

Turned out pretty good, I think. Of course, the first thing Shanin says to me is "it would look better on a girl". So
now I'm basically too self-conscious to wear the damn thing. Boo!

Any rate, if there's anyone out there who wants a nice, hand-made, warm hat which looks pretty good FOR FREE, just lemme
know. Since my site isn't fully operational, hit me up [on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/josh.wickham) and lemme know. Seriously, it's free. I know
the second picture makes it loko uneven, but it really isn't; it's the best hat I've made yet. It's a little loose where
I seamed it together on top, but that's about it.

Questions:

**q**: What size is it?

**a**: I dunno; slightly tight on me? So... normal? When I go go-karting, I wear a large size helmet, if that helps
