<p>So, I'm not going to be able to process 100 photos per day today or tomorrow; I'm enjoying a nice weekend in Carmel with Shanin. Darn!</p>
<p>This brings to mind what the 30 Day challenges mean to me. As mentioned, it's a way to improve myself gradually; one thing at a time. Also, it gives me a chance to see if I take to any particular things without putting a bunch of effort, time, or money into it -- just get my toes wet, as it were. Some months, like this one, it will be things I want to accomplish or complete. Others it will be something I want to learn how to do. There'll be others where I try to incorporate some new habit into my life.</p>
<p>So, how seriously should I take these challenges? How should I approach not doing them for a couple days? Should I be upset that I'm not doing my photo management today or tomorrow? On the one hand, I'm not doing all 30 (or 31 this month) days. On the other hand, I planned for this and don't want to go through all the effort of being able to do it. The photos are at home, on my home comp. Sure, I probably&nbsp;<em>could</em> set up to do them, but I don't really want to.</p>
<p>So, I think that my general feeling is "make sure to do it whenever you reasonably can, but don't sweat it too bad if you don't". There's no deadline. There's no deliverable. I'm not getting paid to do this, and none of these things are things I'm doing currently. If I do something which improves my life 28 out of 30 days instead of 30 out of 30, then what's the big deal?</p>
<p>Any rate, enough rambling; time to get back to relaxing! I have more ramblings I'll likely voice tomorrow about whether I should metrics/gamify my 30 Days journey. Ciao!</p>
