In the post about my [Porsche Assembly Timelapse]((% post_url 2017-11-20-porsche-timelapse-assembly.md %}),
I didn't mention one of my favorite parts of that shoot: building a sled which moved my camera very slowly,
allowing the panning in the end video.

One of the challenges was to make sure that the sled moved enough; it had to move maybe three feet in
roughly half an hour. I'm sure there's commercial stuff I could get for this, but I figured I could make
something using Lego.

And, at the end of the day, I was right!

I modeled the sled around the Mindstorms NXT brain which I had laying around and one of the large motors
for easy torque. Since I had to reduce the speed a lot, I figured I should use something with more torque
to get through all the gear reductions.

As you can see, there's a bunch of gears there, just making the drive shaft move slower and slower. At the
end of it, you can barely see the wheels turning despite the motor moving at a decent clip.

After I got the gearing and everything working, I built up a cradle for the camera, just slapping pieces
together until the camera would sit at the correct angle for quite some time.

To do the shooting, I didn't do anything glamorous; just set up a plank of wood between a couple of chairs,
hooked up the NXT to AC power so it could last, set up some lights, put the sled on one end and pressed go.

Fun fact: the pauses in the middle of the video were unintentional; the sled got caught a couple of times
and I didn't notice (I mean, the sled basically looked like it was stopped all the time) and I wasn't going
to disassemble the Porsche just to reshoot, so I added some smoothing in post and it worked out pretty well!

Any rate, I had a lot of fun putting this together, and I hope that you enjoy it too!
