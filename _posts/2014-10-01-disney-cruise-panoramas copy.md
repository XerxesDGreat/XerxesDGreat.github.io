I took a number of panoramas while we were on our Disney Cruise because sometimes a normal-sized picture just doesn't
capture enough. <strike>Due to various technical difficulties and limitations, I've moved them onto a separate static page;
you can find it here:  <http://www.i-josh.com/chyrp/static/pages/pano.php>. Please, feel free to enjoy them and have a
look!. For a preview, here's thumbnails of the panos:</strike> <strike>**UPDATE** The panoramas be here soon; I kinda broke/lost them 
during a couple unfortunate computer migrations, so I'm rebuilding them.</strike> 

Here we go; I rebuilt the panoramas so they're back up and running; woo!
