Hey all, since I gave you [the Tumbler timelapse]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2015-03-29-time-lapse-lego-assembly-the-tumbler.md %}) two days early, I'm taking this opportunity to do a little
upkeep and behind-the-scenes modifications. All I've done is update the OpenGraph meta tags so my posts show up better
on Facebook.

That's it.

Nothing else.
 
No, seriously.
