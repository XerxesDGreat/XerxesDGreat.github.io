I turned 40 this year and, in celebration of this, my wife wanted to do something special for me. I'd been watching a bit of [Chef's Table](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4295140/) on Netflix and one of the places on the show was right over in SF, so she figured why not get us a dinner there?

The place, of course, is [Atelier Crenn](https://www.ateliercrenn.com/), a two Michelin Star (update: three star now!) restaurant which does a lot of ocean-inspired fare.

As this was our first time at a fancy restaurant, we didn't know what to expect. However, the staff was EXTREMELY attentive; they got us situated, made us comfortable, and took care of everything. I mean, they even switched out our napkins if either of us went to the restroom (and we did a couple times each because we were there for hours).

It felt like we had two people dedicated to just our table, and we probably did as there were only _maybe_ 10 tables in the whole place; it felt quite exclusive.

But the food. There were 7 courses of dinner and 8 courses of dessert, so already a great proportion. The food was _fantastic_; all of it was so flavorful and rich. Despite that, the portions were manageable and tuned for "you're gonna eat a ton of little dishes" so we felt satisfied but not stuffed at the end.

Much of it was seafood or seafood-based; we even got to try geoduck which I had heard of and intellectually knew was a thing that could be eaten, but never thought I'd try.

Two of my favorites were the "adult cereal" (pictured above), which was savory with a kind of texture of oatmeal; I have no idea everything which was in it aside from "some form of seafood and grain" but I would love to start all my days with this.

The other I really loved was wagyu beef with shaved white truffles (above). The truffles were an expensive add-on but they _did not skimp_; they completely hid the beef! Man, it was just so tender and tasty!

The desserts were the show pieces, IMO. They tasted so good, but the presentation was top-notch.

At one point, it was almost "how do I even eat this?" Or, also, "what is even edible here?"

I mean, whose hand is that? Was that custom-made for this dish, or are there just... hand plates somewhere that I don't know about?

This one was pretty cool; it was tobacco-leaf-scented fog along with the rest of the dessert which was vanilla (if I remember correctly). Besides being visually impressive, it smelled heavenly; the tobacco was such a good accenting scent for the food, which was a surprise.

By the end of the night, we were super happy with the experience and, as I mentioned, weren't hungry or stuffed. I don't think I could do a meal like this every night (_certainly_ can't afford it!) but I'm super grateful that my wife treated me to this. If it's a once-in-a-lifetime experience, I'm okay with it!
