<p>Didn't have a bunch of new stuff. I learned a couple tricks 2 days ago, but I feel like I need more in terms of technique, so I've done a lot of practicing. I've gotten pretty good at a double-lift, getting about 70-80% success rate on those. Of course, I still get stumbles and triple-lifts, so that's still ongoing. Always will be, I suppose!</p>
<p>Today I started another technique, the color change. This is another thing I can practice while just hanging around, I think, similar to how I've been practicing double-lifts and passes. Still not great with the passes; I want to practice more, but I feel like I don't have the angles down right and don't want to drive something bad into my habit. Double-lifts are far easier to practice and, imo, more impressive. I guess I just gotta knuckle down.</p>
