As a team building (pun intended) event, the Infrastructure team at Life360 purchased the new [LEGO UCS Millennium Falcon](https://brickset.com/sets/75192-1/Millennium-Falcon) for the team to assemble over time. I figured "hey, I like doing LEGO timelapses; let's set up a camera and get a timelapse of the whole thing!".

Because this was at work, this took... some time to get done; I think the thing was purchased in Oct or so, so it's been several months in the building. But now, it is complete! And we have a video! Enjoy!
